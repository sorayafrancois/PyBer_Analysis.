# PyBer_Analysis.
### Project Overview 
The purpose of this analysis is to create a visual summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural) and to compare their performace. Business recommendations are also provided to address potential disparities among city types. 
### Resources
Data Sources: All data used in this analysis is found inside of the [Resources Folder](https://github.com/sorayafrancois/PyBer_Analysis./tree/main/Resources)

Software: Python 3.7, Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook
### Results

As the DataFrame shows urban city have the most amount PyBer  total rides with 1625 rides and the rural cities have the least total rides with 125 rides
### Total Fares

urban cities not only have the most rides but they also have the higest total of fares

### Summary and Recomindations
In this analysis, it is found that Rural cities have disproportionately higher fare prices and lower driver options than Urban and Suburban cities. These high Rural prices may be offputting to potential customers and deter new users from trying PyBer. More drivers are needed to service Rural cities to lower fare prices in these areas. This can be emplimited by offering driver incentives in rural areas,investing in advertising in rural cities and also offering promotonal discounts to potentila rural customers
